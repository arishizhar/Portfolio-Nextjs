            I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on the MERN stack,
            particularly React and Express. I began my career in 2022 as a
            backend developer at Tata 1mg, working with Ruby on Rails to build
            scalable web services. Later, I pursued a Master's in Applied
            Computing in Canada, which deepened my understanding of software
            development and modern web technologies

            I currently build responsive, high-performance web applications
            using tools like Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, and NestJS. I'm
            always exploring better ways to architect solutions and write clean,
            maintainable code. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can
            apply my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and grow within a
            collaborative engineering team
